<strong>For Graduate Students:</strong> <br>
 Email Dr. Hay directly, at haybruce@caltech.edu, with a pdf version of your CV. He will follow up to meet and talk about rotation opportunities.

<strong>For Undergraduate researchers:</strong> <br>
We have had many undergraduate researchers over the years, and they have gone on to enjoy great success in a number of areas. We are now accepting highly motivated, serious and committed students to work on projects in the lab. Email haybruce@caltech.edu with your CV with GPA, major, courses taken, intended hours in the lab per week, previous research experience, and future goals. Dr. Hay will follow up to meet and talk about opportunities available.

<strong>Postdoctoral position: Mitochondrial DNA quality control:</strong> <br>
 Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes RNAs and proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation, the primary method of ATP production in nucleated cells. mtDNA often exists in a state of heteroplasmy, in which deleterious mutant mtDNA co-exists in cells along with wildtype mtDNA. Heteroplasmy for pathogenic mutations is common, and high frequencies of mutant mtDNA result in severe maternally inherited syndromes. mtDNA mutations also accumulate over time and contribute to a number of diseases of aging including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and sarcopenia. Reducing heteroplasmy is therefore an important therapeutic goal. We have developed systems in which heteroplasmy for a specific lethal mtDNA deletion can be created at will in vivo. We find that mtDNA quality control is normally weak, but can be dramatically enhanced in multiple ways to promote the selective elimination of deletion-bearing mtDNA [ref](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13100){:target="\_blank"}

Our goal is to use this system, and/or related systems in mammalian cells, to understand the basis for mtDNA quality control, and how to stimulate it, in somatic cells and in the germline.

<strong>Postdoctoral position: Engineering the plant mitochondrial genome:</strong> <br>
 We are interested in engineering the plant mitochondrial genome as a platform for synthetic biology and crop enhancement, something that thus far has only been possible in single-celled organisms such as yeast and algae. Work on this project occurs in collaboration with the lab of [Elliot Meyerowitz](http://plantlab.caltech.edu){:target="\_blank"}, also at Caltech.

<strong>Postdoctoral Position: Gene drive for population replacement/alteration or population suppression.</strong> Our goal is to create strong gene drive methods that are robust to evolutionary pressures, and that can be implemented in diverse species.
